# CS 445 Final Project - Focus Stacking

An implemenation of laplacian focus stacking and 3d depth mapping from an image stack. 

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

* Python 3 (Tested with 3.11)
* matplotlib
* numpy
* opencv
* sciki-image

### Usage

To generate the naive project results:
- upload **both** the ipnyb file to Google Colab
- make sure to adjust the path to adjust to where the file is located
- alternatively, it may be run using this shared link: https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1kEQG2Etn4phA9W6Wttp1GGGvR6vHn9wk?usp=sharing


To generate project results, run:

```bash
python generate_results.py
```
