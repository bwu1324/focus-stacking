Pseudocode for Focus Stacking and 3D Model Photography Project
Import necessary libraries
(e.g., OpenCV for image processing, NumPy for numerical operations, etc.)
import cv2
import numpy as np
Other necessary libraries
Function to perform focus stacking
def focus_stacking(images):
    # Convert images to grayscale for processing
    gray_images = [cv2.cvtColor(img, cv2.COLOR_BGR2GRAY) for img in images]

    # Apply Laplacian filter to each image to detect edges
    laplacian_images = [cv2.Laplacian(img, cv2.CV_64F) for img in gray_images]

    # Initialize empty array for final focused image
    focused_image = np.zeros_like(images[0])

    # Combine images based on the sharpest areas
    for laplacian, image in zip(laplacian_images, images):
        _, mask = cv2.threshold(np.abs(laplacian), 0, 255, cv2.THRESH_BINARY)
        focused_image = np.where(mask[..., None].astype(bool), image, focused_image)

    return focused_image

Function to implement depth mapping and create 3D model
def depth_mapping(images):
    # Process images to create depth maps
    # Implement depth mapping using weighted sharpness or contrast
    # Create 3D model based on depth maps
    model_3d = None  # Placeholder for the 3D model
    # Detailed implementation goes here 
    return model_3d

Function to create 3D model using Standard model (Bennet and Deeya to explore)
def create_3d_model(image):
    # Process images to create the 3D model
    # Create 3D model based based on the image provided
    model_3d = None  # Placeholder for the 3D model generation using other methods 
    # Detailed implementation goes here
    return model_3d

Main function
def main():
    # Load images
    images = []  # List to store images
    # Code to load images goes here

    # Phase 1: Focus Stacking
    focused_image = focus_stacking(images)

    # Save or display the focused image
    # Code to save/display image goes here

    # Phase 2: Depth Mapping and 3D Model Creation
    model_3d = depth_mapping(images)

    # Save or display the 3D model
    # Code to save/display 3D model goes here

    # Creation of final report and evaluation
    # Code to generate report and evaluate results goes here
